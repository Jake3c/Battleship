# Battleship
C++ PvP Battleship game with simple GUI

This code was implemented using various class structures for a final project in a C++ course.

The published code currently runs a full game corectly, but does not account for user-error or invalid out-of-bounds input.
There is also no terminating command for when a game has successfully ended. The program will run indefinitley in the current "while(true)" loop even after a player has sunken all enemy ships.
